ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hydegustaman
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and coding, well all sort of tech things too.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (combined).
ðŸ“« If happens when you find my codes has an error, or lack of creativity, or maybe has similarity with someone else's code feel free to email me at eggustaman1981@outlook.com I'll be happy to respons it.
 ...

Now, about this project. 

I call it # Dynamic-Caller-Island-iPhone-14-Mock-Up- #
The new caller identifier feature on iPhone 14 is now a HTML-CSS animation...! Or is it vice-versa ??
The codes originally comes from Codepen of @davidhaz, he also has an Instagram account : @david.webdev. 
My codes here were already had few changes. The original codes has image source that only work when you online to internet,
so I've prepare my img src within the uploaded files. You can change to your favourite img and save it to the same folder or make a new folder.
Don't forget to change the img src tag on the HTML file.

Have A Nice Day!!
